# about my website:

I wanna say something about my website. It's not profect, actually i think it's a fail project(it just like a toy..) At first, I just wanna make a profile website different from others, different from the trend.(scrolling page, etc.) implement some interesting things and effect for fun. I'm always be a developer, not a designer. This make me lack of planning my website and just push myself to the hell..(already give up mobile..) I believe the revision is not far away.. So, this website is just showing what I learn, what I can do, you can see many different kinds of coding style in different pages(include javascript, scss). It just entertaining myself like saying..wow, I can build it all by myself from absolutely nothing! Yes, from aws Ec2, domain, backend, frontend, design, I build it all! It's very important to understand each position, I think.(thanks for every friends who bothered by me) I'm still learning, if you have any question or suggestion, feel free to contact me! thanks.
