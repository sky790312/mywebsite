# mywebsite

node server & es6, scss, with webpack

# how to use :

just need npm install & npm start

then it will run node server with port 5000 (or 80 port)

webpack --watch to gen source js/css..

(make sure you had nodejs & webpack..and it seem to had some problem node-sass with nodejs version 4)
